## Notes

When i was working on the viewcreators page the creator data got lost everytime the page refreshes when i was pasing it through props, so i decided to fetch only the data that matched the id of the creator to avoid that issue.I've been using NextJs with tailwindcss so it was challenging to go back to the original css style and routing .
